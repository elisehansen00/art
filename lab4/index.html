					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We are writing some pseudocode for a nice activity, my partner Julia and I decided to teach others how to make guacamole and we also made pseudocode for a card-matching video game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We were a bit confused about the structure of the pseudocode. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> MAKE GUACAMOLE:
						
						START

						// Ingredients
						SET avocados = 2 (medium-sized)
						SET onion = 1 (small, diced)
						SET jalapeño = 1 (medium, minced, leave seeds in) [per Elise’s request]
						SET cilantro = 1/4 cup (chopped)
						SET lime = 1 (juiced)
						SET salt = 1/2 teaspoon (to taste)
						
						// Equipment
						SET cutting board
						SET knife
						SET mixing bowl
						SET fork
						
						// Step 1: Prepare the ingredients
						FUNCTION prepare_ingredients()
							CUT tomatoes into small pieces
							DICE onion
							MINCE jalapeño
							CHOP cilantro
							JUICE lime
						END FUNCTION
						
						// Step 2: Combine ingredients
						FUNCTION combine_ingredients()
							ADD tomatoes to mixing bowl
							ADD onion to mixing bowl
							ADD jalapeño to mixing bowl
							ADD cilantro to mixing bowl
							ADD lime juice to mixing bowl
							ADD salt to mixing bowl
						END FUNCTION
						
						// Step 3: Mix ingredients
						FUNCTION mix_salsa()
							USE spoon to mix all ingredients until well combined
						END FUNCTION
						
						// Step 4: Taste and adjust
						FUNCTION taste_and_adjust()
							IF guacamole is too spicy THEN
								ADD more avocados
							END IF
							IF more flavor is needed THEN
								ADD more lime juice or cilantro
							END IF
						END FUNCTION
						
						// Step 5: Serve
						FUNCTION serve_guacamole()
							PLACE guacamole in serving bow
							ADD pit of avocado to keep fresh
							SERVE with tortilla chips
						END FUNCTION
						
						// Execute the steps
						CALL prepare_ingredients()
						CALL combine_ingredients()
						CALL mix_guacamole()
						CALL taste_and_adjust()
						CALL serve_guacamole()
						
						END

						CARD MATCHING GAME:

						POSSIBLE CARD ICONS:

						BAT - PUMPKIN - WITCH-HAT - WEBS
						<img class="bat" src="./img/bat.png">
						<img class="pumpkin" src="./img/pumpkin.png">
						<img class="witchhat" src="./img/witchhat.png">
						<img class="webs" src="./img/web.png">

						Create user as “Player” and create game as “Computer” 
						One face-down card is displayed in front of the player. 
						Four face-up cards are layered in front of the player's face-down card.
						Player selects from the four face-up card icons. 
						The player guesses which icon will appear on the face-down card.
						Face down card flips over to reveal icon.
						If cards do not match, 1 point is gained for the computer.
						If cards do not match, the turned over cards reset.
						If cards do match, player gains one point.
						If cards do match, the turned over card resets.
						Point totals are tallied
						Cards reset and replaced with different order of cards.
						User wins or loses after 5 turns 
						Game point tallies reset back to 0 and all cards reset

						IN PSEUDOCODE:

						1. // Print the five cards (with each icon)
						2. // Accept user input
						3. // Validate user move
						4.//  Evaluate if the cards match
						5. // Tally round points
						6. // Choose computer move
						7. // Test of win or draw condition

						</p>

						<pre><code>
