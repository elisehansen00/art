			<h1>Lab 3 - Structured Filing or Filing Structures?!</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> Working with a partner, we must set up a webpage for Lab 3 and upload our screenshots to said page. We also should be sure to verify that we understand how to "push" our changes made into our code editor onto our webpage, so that the page can be viewed by internet users and people who will grade our work!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I was slightly confused by what exactly we needed screenshots of when submitting this lab, by I referenced the assingment and then copy and pasted notes on it into a shared Google Doc with my partner, Julia. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assingment went well! It is always great to work with Julia and she offered to ask any questions I might have had during her section, which was super nice since my section happens after this lab is due! I put in extra effort to making sure my homepage looks cute and that I have every lab linked along with this page from my site's home, so that future assingments will be easier! </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Another cool webpage for the books! </p>
