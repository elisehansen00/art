					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We looked for cool websites and would love to imitate some of their amazing features.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> There are so many cool sites that it was hard to narrow it down! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> It went well! It wasn't hard to find a partner and we worked well together to coordinate our Google Doc. I spent a lot of time exploring different websites through the links provided and I also browsed my old Twitter page for any inspiration since I follow a lot of various analog and digital artists. </p>
