					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I am just a girl in the world. I am an art major who wants to become a UX/UI designer someday. I would love to learn Figma and to code in a few languages. I know some HTML but not a lot. My hobbies include photography, making collages, walking a ton, learning about history, cooking, and being in nature. I am a capricorn sun, gemini moon, and taurus rising.</p>
